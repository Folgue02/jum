# JUM 
JUM stands for `Java Utility Manager`. This tool is able to install JAR files in the JUM repository *(`~/.jumrepo`)* and generate executable scripts *(currently, JUM only generates perl scripts for Unix systems, but in the future batch scripts will be generated for Windows systems)* for those tools.

For more information about this tool, run JUM with the  `--help` flag *(you have to package the project first `mvn package` and then run with `java -jar jum-jar.jar`)*.
